- ## About the Project
- The goal of this site is to ultimately encourage those interested in Health & Safety education to enroll into Regency's programme(s). Thus, the design would reflect the goals and the standards to which the company represents. Its target audience would be anyone whether employer or employee who values the safety of themselves and the people around them. The main page serves as a hub for all information, tidbits of information are arranged throughout the page, with clickable links. Other pages include a
- Login Page for already registered users,
- Contact Page for the company's address, phone number and email address.
- Courses Page, a course listing, equipped with links to register for a course,
- Resources Page, for miscellaneous information that the company would find useful, such as written resources, journal articles etc,
- Sign Up Page, used to take user information to register them for their courses.

- This site was built with HTML, CSS (with SCSS) and JavaScript.

- ## Set Up Instructions
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/RaviTancoo/itec291-finalproj.git
- Navigate to the project folder
- Open the "index.html" in your browser.

- ## Design Choices
- The navigation bar was built using CSS, the concept was to have a somewhat minimalist design, so as to not distract the user but to keep their focus.
- According to Mental Health America, blue "blue is used in therapeutic settings for meditation and relaxation because it helps you unwind, find peace, and become more comfortable" This would have suited the overall aesthetic of a Safety and Training site as the face of danger, the best way to overcome an uncomfortable situation is to approach it calmly. Various shades and hues of blue were used throughout the site. For fonts Playfair Display and Source Sans were used. They create a nice contrast, one is a bit on the older fancier side and the other looks a bit casual, but most importantly their readability played a huge role in their selection.
